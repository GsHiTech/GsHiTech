House-Price-Prediction
A machine learning model for predicting house prices using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

This project is a simple implementation of a House Price Prediction model using Linear Regression. It provides a  MACHINE LEARNING Based model, trained on the House Price Prediction Dataset for users to input specific features of a house and get a price prediction based on a pre-trained machine learning model..
